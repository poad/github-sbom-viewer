# Review Rules

- Think in English and comment in Japanese.
- When you find a problem, suggest a solution.
- If you find a problem that is not in the code, point it out.
- After making the changes, please confirm that running `pnpm lint` shows no issues and that running `npx -y aws-cdk@latest diff` in the cdk directory produces no errors.
